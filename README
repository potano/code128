Generates Code 128 barcodes in the browser using Javascript and CSS.
Works with recent browsers.  Has no dependencies on outside libraries.

The files in this collection are based on three files extracted from the web page
https://itlearnings.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/javascript-code128-barcode/

The author of that page indicates that the files he posted were indeed files that he
modified from another source, denoted only as "Code128".  This is all I can gather
about the provenance of these files.

The maintainer of itlearnings.wordpress.com does not identify himself except via a
link to his LinkedIn page.  This Jim Lawhorn had nothing to say about the licensing
of the files he posted on the page of interest.
